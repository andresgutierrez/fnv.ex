Pure Elixir implementation of **Fowler–Noll–Vo hash functions**

> Fowler–Noll–Vo is a non-cryptographic hash function created by Glenn Fowler, Landon Curt Noll, and Phong Vo.
>
> The basis of the FNV hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent as reviewer comments to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2
> committee by Glenn Fowler and Phong Vo in 1991. In a subsequent ballot round, Landon Curt Noll improved on their
> algorithm. Some people tried this hash and found that it worked rather well. In an email message to Landon, they named
> it the Fowler/Noll/Vo or FNV hash.
